title: What you need to understand to write testable prose in markdown
---

To write testable prose in markdown, you'll need to understand:

- how to write prose in markdown
- how to write [concordion tests in the language of your choice](http://concordion.org/Ports.html)


Both markdown and [concordion](http://concordion.org/) are widely used:  Google will find you plenty of help if you want to understand either the markdown prose or the  java test in this template project.
